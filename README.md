# 📐 Design Patterns in Software Engineering

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Software Engineering** repository! This collection covers various design patterns, explaining their intent, motivation, and real-world examples. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned developer, this repository can help improve your understanding of design principles for creating flexible and maintainable code.

## 📖 Introduction

Design patterns are standardized solutions to common software design problems. These patterns streamline the development process and make your code more modular, flexible, and reusable. This repository contains practical examples of design patterns in software engineering, helping you understand when and how to implement each.

## 📂 Pattern Categories

Patterns are organized into three main categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns
   - [Singleton](patterns/creational/Singleton.md) - Ensures a class has only one instance.
   - [Factory Method](patterns/creational/FactoryMethod.md) - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects.
   - [Abstract Factory](patterns/creational/AbstractFactory.md) - Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. Structural Patterns
   - [Adapter](patterns/structural/Adapter.md) - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - [Composite](patterns/structural/Composite.md) - Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
   - [Decorator](patterns/structural/Decorator.md) - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
   - [Observer](patterns/behavioral/Observer.md) - Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all its dependents are notified.
   - [Strategy](patterns/behavioral/Strategy.md) - Allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
   - [Command](patterns/behavioral/Command.md) - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

Each pattern includes:
- **Intent**: What the pattern does.
- **Motivation**: The problem it solves.
- **Structure**: UML diagram and structure.
- **Example Code**: Practical example of the pattern.
- **Use Cases**: When to use it.
- **Pros and Cons**: Benefits and trade-offs.

## 📘 How to Use

Each pattern has its own markdown file in the `patterns` directory, organized by category. To try out code examples:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fawadeqbal/Design-Patterns-in-Software-Engineering.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific pattern folder.
3. Open the code files to see the pattern implementation.
